# Predecessor Array

We provide a simple predecessor array data structure for tree representation. This lib uses (fera-graph)[https://github.com/malbarbo/fera/tree/master/graph], from (fera)[https://github.com/malbarbo/fera] project, for graph representation.

So far, there is only support for _Static Graph_ representation, but we intend to give support to generic graph types provided by (fera-graph)[https://github.com/malbarbo/fera/tree/master/graph].
